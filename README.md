Files included: 
-driver.java
-encryptor.java
-logger.java


Below I explain how to compile and run my project: 
	1. type the following to compile driver.java: "javac driver.java"

	2. To run driver type the following: "java driver <logFileName>.txt	-feel free to replace "<logFileName>" with any name for the log text file

	3. Once driver runs, it should automatically handle the compilation and running of the encryptor and logger

	4. After that a prompt should appear asking to enter a command(enter commands as they appear or it will ask you to reenter).

	5. If entering new string to use for password, encryption, or decryption, PLEASE make sure to only use alphabetical characters, as I did not add 	validation for them. 

	6. Make sure that all commands that preceed an argument are capitalized 

	7. The encryptor will automatically convert your string arguments and its output to uppercase letters
